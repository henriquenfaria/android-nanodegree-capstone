Wise Trip
======

This is the Capstone Project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

Wise Trip helps you organize your business and personal trips by recording your expenses,
budget and the places you want to visit.

1. Record travel expenses: Add new expenses with a press of a button, using the app or the
home screen widget. Select the currency, the date, the category and add photos to an
place.
2. Stop overspending: Create different budgets for each currency or category. It automatically
converts it to your home country currency.
3. Manage your itinerary: Never get lost again! Add places you want to visit for each trip and
easily get directions to it.
4. Never lost your data again: All your trip data is securely saved in the cloud.
